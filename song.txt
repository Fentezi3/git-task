Crucify my love
If my love is blind
Crucify my love
If it sets me free
Never know Never trust
"That love should see a color"
Crucify my love
If it should be that way

Swing the heartache
Feel it inside out
When the wind cries
I'll say good-by
Tried to learn Tried to find
To reach out for eternity
Where's the answer
Is this forever

Like a river flowing to the sea
You'll be miles away, and Iwill know
I know I can deal with the pain
No reason to cry
